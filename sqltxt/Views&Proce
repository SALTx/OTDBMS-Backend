ok, I need your help with SQL, before everything starts, I need to feed you the data, and background settings for a system,the overseas student program management system, students can be out for educational trips, immersion programs, or overseas internships. the overseas region is classified as ACI countries or Non-ACI countries. ACI stands for ASEAN  CHINA INDIAN, 
We have KPIs given for how many students should go for overseas in total, currently I have 3 tables.
overseasProgrammes table:programmeId,programmeName,programmeType,startDate,endDate,country,aciCountry
students table:studAdmin,studName,admissionYear,gender,birthday,citizenshipStatus,diploma,pemName(pem is the student's private mentor for his acadamic life, something like a form teacher)
trips table:tripId,studAdmin,programmeId

well, I need the outline of some good ideas of views and procedures. I do need not the actual codes, just some outlines, this might sound confusing, but I have 4  examples here of what I want you to produce.
