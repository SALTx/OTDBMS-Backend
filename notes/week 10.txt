1. genuinely dont understand how you couldnt do 6 since all you
 do is use chatgpt for everything, but I added it in the deploy script 
 with null safe equal operator instead

2. Theres sql errors when trying to run the deploy script. 
fix them.
*no errors when trying to run the deploy script on my side*

3. ps. even the triggers and procedures arent consistent with the 
naming convention. fix that too.

4. Primary Key: In the oimpDetails table, the primary key is 
defined on the studAdmin column. If there can be multiple rows with 
the same studAdmin value, you should reconsider the primary key 
definition.
*changed to composite primary key*

5. Missing Table Constraints: Some tables are missing constraints 
such as NOT NULL for certain columns. Ensure that the appropriate 
constraints are applied to maintain data integrity.
*checked and fixed some, rest are 
missed on purporse to allow null value for some columns*

6. Views: The views defined in the code seem fine, but it's always 
a good practice to include column aliases for the aggregated 
columns in the views to improve readability.
*done*

7. 'TIMestAMP' in line 90. do i honestly need to explain this 
overseasPartnerType
*fixed typo*

8. duplicate foreign key constraint in oimpDetails and trips
*removed oimpDetails programId, use studAdmin to link to trips*

9. Delimiter Usage: The DELIMITER statement is used correctly in 
most places. However, in the getProgramAcronym stored procedure, you 
missed setting the delimiter at the end of the procedure definition. 
Add DELIMITER ; after the END statement of the procedure.
    * I just went ahead and did this myself since you werent in your 
    lab the 2 times i checked

10. line 278 has estNumStudents instead of estNumStudents. this is 
genuinely the 3rd week in a row where you havent fixed this. Id ask 
you how you failed to ctrl + f and change all instances but ill just 
ask you in person isntead xoxo
    * again, i made the change, just writing it here to keep track.

11. see if you can implement env variables for the db connection in the 
deploy script. it would be nice to not have to change the script every 
time we want to deploy to a different db.
    * this also applies to the python scripts that automate data 
    insertion

    1. aciCountry value changed to bit for consistency.
    2. merge estimated and expected dates into one column

    4. add more clarity to the kpi with the help of description, add readable headers
        * optional make one view for all kpis that return 3 rows with 2 columns

    5. problems with uploading data for the overseasprograms table
    6. add comments to code for future maintainers.
