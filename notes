\*done\*
1. Finalize database name, we already had overseas-travel
\*this is for easy auto-increment of program id, changing to others will cause the process to be more tedious and increase server work load during bulk inserts\*
2. wtf is 'A' and 'N' as the enum. whats wrong with 'Yes' and 'No'. Even a bit would have been acceptable as a datatype where 1 = True and 0 = False
\*done\*
3. EstNumStudents is not camelcase \*still
\*done, but 2 seperate views of each kpi is requested by supervisor so it remains\*
4. Keep the kpi names as they were and add a comment over it or even add a description column since they only return one row

\* work in progress\*
5. Figure out how to keep track of previous years' KPI
\*\*also see if you can calculate the predicted values and give it its own col

\*un-implementable with my skills\*
6. Simplify the overseasprogram update trigger to check if the row is different, dont check for each column individually because theres a lot of them. and also when the table changes it wont reflect in the trigger 

\*done\*
7. separate the dummy data into its own file, the deploy is only meant to be run once at the start of the project to create empty tables

\* deleted primary key as it is pointless, use program id and timestamp to locate changes instead\*
8. about audit table
