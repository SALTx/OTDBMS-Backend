1. Finalize database name, we already had overseas-travel
2. wtf is 'A' and 'N' as the enum. whats wrong with 'Yes' and 'No'. Even a bit would have been acceptable as a datatype where 1 = True and 0 = False
3. EstNumStudents is not camelcase \*still
4. Keep the kpi names as they were and add a comment over it or even add a description column since they only return one row
   \*\*also see if you can calculate the predicted values and give it its own col
5. Figure out how to keep track of previous years' KPI
6. Simplify the overseasprogram update trigger to check if the row is different, dont check for each column individually because theres a lot of them. and also when the table changes it wont reflect in the trigger
7. separate the dummy data into its own file, the deploy is only meant to be run once at the start of the project to create empty tables
