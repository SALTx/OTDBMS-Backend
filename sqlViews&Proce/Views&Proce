I need help with SQL, before everything starts, this is the background settings. This is a database for a overseas student program management system, students can be out for educational trips, immersion programs, or overseas internships. 
We have KPIs given for how many students should go for overseas in total, and in case you dont understand what is pemName, a pem is soemthing like a form teacher

well, I need the outline of some good ideas of views and procedures. before everything starts, this is the background settings. This is a database for a overseas student program management system, students can be out for educational trips, immersion programs, or overseas internships. 
We have KPIs given for how many students should go for overseas in total, and in case you dont understand what is pemName, a pem is soemthing like a form teacherI do need not the actual codes, just some outlines, this might sound confusing, but I have 4  examples here of what I want you to produce.
