# Overseas Travel Database Management System

## About

This project aims to make database management easier for the purposes of tracking NYPs overseas travel programs as well as the students that participated in it. It also helps visualize whether certain metrics such as KPIs set by MOE are being met. This is all possible through a front end that allows you to query a database without having any programming experience making this information more accessible to lecturers and NYP faculty without a single line of code

## Technologies used

PHP for the front end
MySQL for the database
Apache for hosting the server
