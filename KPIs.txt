***EXACT QUOTE FROM DRCHING***

KPI 1:    It counts the number of unique students that have done any overseas exposure (OET, OITP or OIMP etcâ€¦.) in any countries during their study in School of Engineering/ NYP

KPI 2:    It is the same as KPI 1 except that the overseas exposure countries have to be one of the countries in ASEAN, China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan),  or India

KIP3:     It only counts the number of unique students that have done OITP in ASEAN, China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan),  or India.

Example 1: If students do OITP in Japan, Australia or Europe, it is not counted as KPI 3 as countries are not correct.

Example 2: Students do OIMP in China also not counted as KPI 3 as KPI 3 only counts OITP.

Example 3: Students do OET in Malaysia not counted as KPI 3 as KPI 3 only counts OITP.

now i will explain my reqiurements and my table to you. for Date, i want the value as month+year eg. September 2023 if `Approve Status` is 'Rejected' or 'Pending'
and the value as dd/mm/yyyy(start date) to dd/mm/yyyy(end date) if  `Approve Status` is 'Approved'.
there is a duration difference between different program Type. for 'Overseas internship program',it should be at least 3 months long and not more than 6 months.
for other type of trips, it should be at least 7 days and not more than 14 days. 
  'Overseas educational trip','Overseas internship program','Overseas immersion program', should take up 90% of the trip generated, 
  the other trip types share the rest of the 10%
