***EXACT QUOTE FROM DRCHING***

KPI 1:    It counts the number of unique students that have done any overseas exposure (OET, OITP or OIMP etcâ€¦.) in any countries during their study in School of Engineering/ NYP

KPI 2:    It is the same as KPI 1 except that the overseas exposure countries have to be one of the countries in ASEAN, China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan),  or India

KIP3:     It only counts the number of unique students that have done OITP in ASEAN, China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan),  or India.

Example 1: If students do OITP in Japan, Australia or Europe, it is not counted as KPI 3 as countries are not correct.

Example 2: Students do OIMP in China also not counted as KPI 3 as KPI 3 only counts OITP.

Example 3: Students do OET in Malaysia not counted as KPI 3 as KPI 3 only counts OITP.
